## Overview

This project uses Xiaomi AI Glasses to recognize Rubik's cubes and provides optimal solutions (within 20 moves) in under 1 second, then demonstrates each move with 3D animations, making solving Rubik's cubes easier and more fun than ever before.

## Features

- **📷 Smart Recognition**: Automatically captures photos using Xiaomi AI Glasses and recognizes cube state using YOLO11 + OpenCV.
- **⚡️ Fast Solving**: Uses Kociemba's two-phase algorithm to provide optimal solutions (within 20 moves) in under 1 second.
- **🎲 3D Visualization**: Displays realistic 3D animations on a web page, step-by-step demonstrating how to rotate each face of the cube.
- **🔊 Voice Guidance**: Supports real-time voice interaction to get operation hints for each step (Xiaomi AI Glasses have no screen).

## Technical Details

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note: The following operations are based on ADB debugging mode, but Xiaomi AI Glasses do not enable this feature by default, so you may not be able to reproduce this project.

First, we obtain images and voice interaction records from Xiaomi AI Glasses via ADB ([related code](src/chat/adb.py)).

After obtaining the images, we use an object detection model (based on [YOLO11m](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect)) to identify the cube position ([related code](src/vision/predict.py) | [model download](https://github.com/idootop/MigicCube/releases/tag/model)).

Then we use OpenCV for perspective transformation to correct the image and identify the color of each face's color blocks ([related code](src/vision/image.py)).

Next, we use the [Kociemba](https://github.com/hkociemba/RubiksCube-TwophaseSolver) two-phase solving algorithm to provide optimal solutions within 20 moves in under 1 second ([related code](src/cube/kociemba.py) | [pruning table download](https://github.com/idootop/MigicCube/releases/tag/kociemba)).

Finally, we synchronize the solution to the web interface and use [Roofpig](https://github.com/larspetrus/Roofpig) to display 3D cube animations ([related code](src/web/index.html)).
